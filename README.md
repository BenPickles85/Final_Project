# Final_Project

Due to the confidential nature of some data (names etc) I have not included public access to this so the cleaning notebooks are unable to be run. 

However, the output CSV's that no longer has the confidential data are present and so the modelling notebooks will run and the app will deploy using github pages without issue.
